Although I am not quick to make such an assumption, it does appear as though the so-called cryptocurrency winter is over and the price of tokens will continue to surge. As a dedicated watcher of Bitcoin and altcoins in general, I was shocked to see an almost overnight shift in the value of <a  style="color:slateblue; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2019/07/04/where-will-bitcoins-price-go-next/#3b5f07923b59">Bitcoin</a> and which recently finished trading with a value of over $5,000 per coin.

As altcoins around the world saw their price slashed in recent weeks, the rise of the original cryptocurrency led many to question what was behind such a stunning surge in cost. Rumors have been swirling of a major buyer placing a huge order with traders of cryptocurrencies which led to trading taking such an unexpected turn.

Like me, you may have been shocked by the surging value of tokens to over $5,000 for the first time in 2019. By my calculations, the rise to over $5,240 per bitcoin is the highest the tokens have moved to since November 2018 and comes at a time when altcoins have been struggling to hold their value.

There are many who believed cryptocurrencies would struggle to maintain their mark on the markets but I have always believed they would make a dominant return at some point in 2019. Although one would have expected more signals of a return, I tend to agree with The deVere Group Founder, Nigel Green who feels this surge will signal the return of cryptocurrencies to a period of dominance on the markets which should be sustained into the coming years.
