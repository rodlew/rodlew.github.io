<b>What Is UBI and What It Means For You</b>
<br>

Did you know that in the next ten years or more a lot of people are in danger of losing their employment because of technology? That also means that these people are in danger of losing their current healthcare plans. <br><br>

<b>What can you do?</b>
<br>

Andrew Yang has come up with a universal healthcare solution for America in his bid for the 2020 presidential seat. Some of the key points of his plan are listed below. 
<br><br>


<b>What Is UBI?</b>

UBI is a basic healthcare plan guaranteeing you a certain amount of money every month, somewhat similar to social security. 

Andrew's 2020 platform will guarantee every American $12,000 a year for healthcare without jumping through any of the current hoops.

<br><br>





<b>Why Yang thinks it will work.</b>
<br>

Technology is taking over the world. Did you know that a few years ago more than 4 million people lost their jobs due to automation? They lost their healthcare when this shift happened. 
<Br>

Andrew's proposal will give every recipient a chance to have basic, quality healthcare,regardless of employment status. Technology has allowed workers to move away from boring, mundane jobs but at a small price. They have lost their healthcare coverage in the process. How is that going to help those who need to choose between paying the rent or going to the hospital? Andrew Yang's plan is intended to reduce the pressure by providing a basic plan to everyone in America. 
<br><br>

<b>Who Benefits?</b>

<br>

Those who are 18 years of age and older get a check every month. 
<br><br><br>


<b>How does it Work?</b>
<br>

Andrew is proposing a cut to other social programs that welfare recipients have. He is also proposing a VAT. A VAT will keep corporations from taking the money from you in the future. 
<br><br><br>

<b>What Are the Benefits?</b>
<br>

1) Some programs punish you when you find work by taking away the benefits. A person does not feel much encouragement to find a job when you are punished. This program allows you to find work and you still receive the benefits. 

<br>

2) The red tape and eligibility requirements are reduced. 
<br>

3) There are a lot of people who face abuse at their jobs. The current system makes sure they stay there if they want to keep the benefits. Andrew's plan will strip that away. You have the right to turn down a job you feel may be too abusive and still get the money. 
<br>

4) People will feel their stress levels reduced through Andrew's plan. 
<br><br><br>

<b>There is evidence to support Andrew's plan. You can view some of the studies at https://www.yang2020.com/35-Ubi-programs-cash-transfer-experiments/?_ga=2.89005400.293038425.1553525037-217574174.1553525037. </b>b
